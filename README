* Forking cauldron tree

 update mageia-release and lsb-release for the new version. Then rebuild
 drakx-installer-binaries, drakx-installer-images, drakx-installer-rescue,
 drakx-installer-stage2.

 fork the cauldron tree to the new release tree :
 valstar# ./fork-distribution /distrib/mirror/distrib/cauldron /distrib/newrelease/1

 Do the same on rabbit (to avoid downloading everything) :
 rabbit# ./fork-distribution /distrib/mirror/distrib/cauldron /distrib/newrelease/1

 clean testing repositories

 Edit media.cfg for x86_64 and i586 :
  - check version
  - update branch to Official
 
 update VERSION file for x86_64 and i586 :
  - /distrib/newrelease/1/x86_65/VERSION
  - /distrib/newrelease/1/i586/VERSION
 (replace Devel with Official)
 
 extract mageia-release-Default package on x86_64 and i586 to copy
 the file product.id.Default as product.id at the root of x86_64 and
 i586 trees 

 submit new mageia-release and lsb-release, updated to cauldron
