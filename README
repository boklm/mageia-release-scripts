* Forking cauldron tree

 When mageia-release and lsb-release have been updated for the new release,
 fork the cauldron tree to the new release tree :
 valstar# ./fork-distribution /distrib/mirror/distrib/cauldron /distrib/newrelease/1

 Do the same on rabbit (to avoid downloading everything) :
 rabbit# ./fork-distribution /distrib/mirror/distrib/cauldron /distrib/newrelease/1

 clean testing repositories

 Edit media.cfg for x86_64 and i586 :
  - check version
  - update branch to Official
